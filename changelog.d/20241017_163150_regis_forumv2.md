- ðŸ’¥[Feature] Switch from the legacy `cs_comments_service` Ruby app to the new forum v2 Python app. In addition, forum data is now stored in MySQL, and not in MongoDb. This considerably simplifies this plugin. Change should be transparent for most users, unless the forum backend has been customised in some way. This is considered a breaking change because the legacy forum will no longer be supported by this plugin. Users who want to keep running `cs_comments_service` will have to create their own plugin.
